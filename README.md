# Credit Score Classification

This repository contains a project focused on building a robust credit score classification model using various machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest classifier emerged as the best-performing model, demonstrating high accuracy and superior classification performance.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a credit score classification model using machine learning techniques. After evaluating several algorithms, the Random Forest classifier was chosen as the final model due to its exceptional performance in accurately predicting credit scores.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of both training and testing data:
- **Training Data:** Used to train and build the machine learning models.
- **Testing Data:** Used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

## Streamlit App

In addition to the model development, an interactive Streamlit web application was created to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting credit scores. The app allows users to input relevant information and receive a predicted credit score based on the trained Random Forest classifier.
